# Trivia Quest

The Trvia Quest is an engaging trivia quiz where users answer 5 random questions from various categories like anime, video games, fantasy books, and board games. After completing the quiz, the user is directed to a results page where their score is visually represented by heart icons, similar to classic video games. The final heart animates to highlight the userâ€™s achievement. The quiz pulls random questions on every playthrough, ensuring that no two games are the same.
